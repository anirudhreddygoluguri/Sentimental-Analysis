The main aim of our project is to classify the comment whether they are toxic or nontoxic by tackling with the big data and high dimensionality challenges associated with text classification. We address the big data challenge by using techniques such as partial fit to reduce the time complexity of the problem. To classify the model, we have used Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Na√Øve Bayes Classification techniques with Gaussian and Multinomial, Random Forest Classification and Multilayer Perceptron techniques. We then used Grid Search and Randomized Search to find the best hyper parameters associated with each classifier. Among the different penalization techniques like L1, L2 norm and elastic net. Gridsearch CV was used to predict the best possible penalization and parameter available in a set to produce high accuracy. These were then used for initial training of the model and the predicting efficiency was found for each classification models.
